# Poly
This is an exercise in polyalphabetic ciphers. 

There will be multiple attempts at solving the sme problem using different languages. While this is not the most difficult task I will enjoy the challenge as it means learning more in languages that I am learning.

This is in no way a secure means of encryption for anything more than a grocery list but it could in theory be used to cause some mild headaches if you encrypted the text two or more times.
